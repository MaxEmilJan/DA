This Repository contains all files and scrips, which are required for this text recognition project to work.
The core algorithm is run on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano. For the computer vision part, a USB-camera is connected to the Jetson.
The Jetson communicates with an Arduino Nano via I2C, which is controlling the Illumination (Adafruit Neopixel RGB Ring).

To get the system up and running, follow the installation_guide.md
